martin:  ahh i see you are happy:)
and online for once
so I hear your studies are going well
we talked about you and your research in some previous emails
but I did not have time to talk to you about it yet
so tell me what you are doing. Cos I was pondering the idea to get you here for some couple of months
well I am doing fine, work and some paper writing
cannot complain
yes yes
I know you do motion generation
I was just wondering how it goes
be back in 5 minutes meanwhile tell me all your stuff
 Sent at 5:11 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  ok so I am back
that however means that yuo want some sort of music analyzer
when I was doing the motion control I did a frequency transform
each dominant frequency was then assigned as a signal both for orientation and amplitude
from there it would be possible to recompose the signal into a more general unit and perhaps you could get some global information about the overall music
However, the ideal would be to actually use the frequency information to modulate the laban equations
well yes general unit - meaning that when you do the FFT/DFT u get a set of frequencies, but they are basically disjoint set of values
as such you break the music and you loose an overall trend
 Sent at 5:32 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  moreover, it would also require a more elaborate method that will allow you to distinguish between principal rhytm frequencies and some hidden ones, as those are quite often very useful in the dance
yes
it can be used to make predictions
a nice application or usage can be to use a ANN to actually do the predictions
indeed
and it can be quite realizable
 Sent at 5:35 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  well, assume you have a set of either pre-programmed motions or a set of equations that generate some motions
in both cases each of these are parametrized by som variables
some
so approach one is to use a Hopfield type of network - self-organizing unsupervised learning that will get inputs from the FFT and generate a set of parameters
the hopfield network is based on a resonant principle so it will converge to some classification
the other approach is to train a perceptron on a set of examples from FFT coefficient to a set of parameters
the general problem remains in formulation of an objective function
but that can be taken as a solution to the Laban equations
 Sent at 5:40 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  well not really if you look at the Laban equations, he does not provide an explicit solution but rather a set of slopes or gradients of how the motions should change
that can be used for learning
u can then define a set of states that represents the robot state and each of them will be representing a type of motions, tired, excited, or so
 Sent at 5:43 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  as far as i know you was able to formulate a set of equations using the laban model, if not one can be done using for instance the Laban effort graph
 Sent at 5:44 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  but are you using them or not?
:))
and do you have any goal right now or no idea?
ok so what is your plan then
so tell me what is your current direction
 Sent at 5:50 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  ok but that sounds quite vague and beside it can be quite hard to integrate multimodal input data to generate dancing motion
well the Laban model is quite feeling based - thus if you define robot states you can exploit it in various maners
 Sent at 5:52 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  nope
 Sent at 5:54 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  and the result?
 Sent at 5:55 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  and what are the results?
 Sent at 5:59 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  hmm did you have pre-programmed motions?
in general the results indicates the fact that the robot did not have any intentions to communicate anything
in its simplest form a pantomime can be a nice example
well there is not interaction in modern dancing as well but people can understand emotions from it
because the dancers can describe their emotions y a set of movements
well me neither i do not understand modern dancing but that is for another dicussion
:)
well in a part yes
well it is also related to the interpretation of the music
but to come back to some projects - the ANN is feasible
also you can use human feedback to teach it
but if you take modern popular music you should be able to extract enough information so the people can say if the robot is happy or not
I would not go in more emotional states because after it becomes quite symbolic and very difficult
well they attacked me on many things:))
actually I would only restrict them to most explicit emotional states
 Sent at 6:07 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  hmm it is a way to go but you have to only select a subset of emotions and you can build a simple model from that
but if you do not want emotions what is the overall goal?
 Sent at 6:09 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  ok so actually for that you do not even need motion sequences just study the transitions between motions I thin
think
 Sent at 6:10 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  well yes yes but you do not need to study the sequences it self as without emotional states they do not have any meaning
 Sent at 6:11 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  yes that sounds reasonable
hehehehehe
yeah ASC 16 are nice
but then also having a sequence of motions you should be able to make them feel in different emotional states if you use some adaptive mechanism
really?
that is why ASC 16 is nice, beside you should not be reading it back, rather send it to a position and assume it arrived when it send feedback
that how I was doing it
 Sent at 6:17 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  well as I said, memorize in your soft
that is the easiest - best trade between speed and efficiency
 Sent at 6:18 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  no
he did not
 Sent at 6:20 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  yuo see for that the FFT would work much better
I see if i can make a connection to some robot here and will send it to you
 Sent at 6:23 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  check my software
It is all there
maybe it needs a good manual tho:))
I am working on it
 Sent at 6:25 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  well I will put it on an svn - now I have a good server available
since i left I did not have time to touch it but it is still on dropbox as well
no problem
maybe i can do it now
yes yes
 Sent at 6:26 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  so anyway I will see if you can come here for couple of months if you want
it is still only a plan but maybe it can be good for you as you will see how the robotics is in Japan
ahhhh well extend it
it is not that difficult - normally
well yeah there are all kinds of them
hahahaha
 Sent at 6:30 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  well let me know if it is possible
I will talk with Perkowski more and we will see what he says
 Sent at 6:32 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  hehehe well now it is mostly calculating as i do not have a robot anymore:)
 Sent at 6:35 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  ok that would be an interesting experience, despite the fact that when i tried it I got quickly bored with it due to some server issues:)
 Sent at 6:36 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  ok then until then work on this so we can put something nice together and publish it:)
 Sent at 6:43 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  ok no problem just keep it up:)
 Sent at 6:46 PM on Tuesday
 martin:  no problem
